# AssetServer
An Experimental Database Server

This is a small server that listens to port 9864. Upon connection, the guest should send the message "Hello!". The server will respond in kind and the connection is terminated. Should the guest not say "Hello!" the server will be upset and tell the connecting guest to Shoo!
